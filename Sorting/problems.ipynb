    "In Python's heapq module, the provided functionalities are primarily for min-heaps (where the smallest element is always at the root). To simulate a max-heap (where the largest element should be at the root), you can utilize negation as a workaround.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for negating the values is to sort elements in the heap in a way that the smallest (negative of the largest) elements appear at the root when using the default min-heap functions provided by heapq.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, when using heapq.heappush() to insert elements into the heap, negating the values prior to insertion essentially reverses their order in terms of magnitude, ensuring that the largest elements (originally negative) appear towards the top of the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "When retrieving elements from the heap using heapq.heappop(), the negation is reverted to obtain the correct positive value of the largest element after its retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workaround allows you to use the heapq module effectively to mimic a max-heap while still using its efficient heap operations for insertion, extraction, and peeking at extreme elements."
